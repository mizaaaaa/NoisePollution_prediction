# 🌍 Noise Pollution Prediction

## 📖 Overview
This project uses **machine learning** to predict urban noise pollution levels in India using data from **2011–2018**. By analyzing environmental and location-based factors, it reveals patterns and trends in noise levels across regions and time periods.  

The model provides **actionable insights** to help city planners, policymakers, and researchers design quieter, healthier cities, while also offering simple **visualizations** for data-driven decisions in urban management.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts noise pollution categories from environmental & location data.  
- Identifies long-term **trends** and hotspots in urban noise.  
- Visualization support for patterns and model accuracy.  
- Deployed as a **Flask web app** for easy access.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)  
- **Web**: Flask  
- **Environment**: Google Colab + Render (deployment)
